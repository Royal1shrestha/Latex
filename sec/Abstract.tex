 The rapid global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has spurred the development of innovative solutions to enhance user convenience and promote sustainable transportation. The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in Nepal has been driven by a mix of environmental consciousness, government policies, infrastructure growth, and technological progress. Technological advancements have improved battery efficiency and range, making EVs more attractive for urban commutes. But even after all these efforts, finding charging stations as well as repair garages has been an obstacle for widespread adoption of EVs in Nepal.  So, my project EV Charge seeks to solve the problem for possible EV owners and buyers to find charging stations and repair garages.  It addresses the integration of local charging station networks, considering factors such as accessibility, charging speed, and compatibility with different EV models. I have planned to use MERN stack for the development of our web application, which will have an efficient,
user-friendly and attractive interface to interact with the data.
