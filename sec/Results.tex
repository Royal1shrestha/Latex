\section{EXPECTED RESULTS}
After the completion of our project, we expect that EV as well CV owners and 
potential buyer will get benefit from this project. Our system aims to significantly boost the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) by alleviating range anxiety through real-time accessibility to EV charging stations. We also expect this project to streamline vehicle maintenance processes, potentially extending vehicle lifespans and minimizing overall ownership costs. The project after completion aims to foster awareness and education about sustainable transportation practices, catalyzing a shift towards greener modes of travel. The convenience offered to users, coupled with transparent and up-to-date information, enhances their overall experience and contributes to informed decision-making. The expected outcomes of the project transcend mere technological advancements. It presents an innovative solution that empowers users, bolsters environmental conservation efforts, stimulates economic savings, and ushers in a more sustainable and interconnected transportation future for Nepal.
